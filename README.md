# BibleMine

Advanced note creation and Bible study tool for the average user.

The goal of this project is to create a Bible reading, exploring and note creation tool for the average user instead of hard-core theologists. We would like to implement a sleek, easy to use, intuitive UI that transforms reading the Bible as a wall of text to an interactive experience.

Please note: This project is on hold. This tool will be reimplemented in React in the future. Currently we are working on [BibleData](https://github.com/KereszTech/BibleData) to create a solid foundation in the form of databases to make this tool truly awesome.
